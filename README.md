# DE (Data Exploration in R)
This repository contains fundamental examples and tutorials for exploring and visualizing data using R, focusing on the `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and `ggplot2` packages. These resources are intended for beginners who want to enhance their data manipulation and visualization skills in R.

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to provide practical, easy-to-understand examples of how to use `dplyr` for data manipulation, `tidyr` for data tidying, and `ggplot2` for creating compelling visualizations. The examples are structured to help users learn how to effectively handle and explore data in R.
